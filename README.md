This is a quick, simple project to demonstrate the knowledge of basic VueJS concepts (components, props, routes, etc). The application uses a Firebase backend that contains posts about how difficult it is to be a sports fan from Cleveland, OH. 

Currently, Vuex is being implemented and will be pushed to the reposition in the coming days.
